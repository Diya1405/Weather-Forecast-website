# Weather-Forecast-website
 The weather forecasting website, developed with React.js, offers a dynamic and interactive
 platform for users to access real-time weather information and forecasts. By leveraging React's state
 management capabilities with useState and useContext hooks, the application efficiently handles user
 inputs and updates global weather data. It involves addressing both functional and non-functional
 requirements. The goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated and user-centric weather forecast
 website utilizing React JS. Users can search for specific cities to retrieve current weather conditions
 and view detailed forecasts for upcoming days that empowering users to make informed decision
 based on weather information.
